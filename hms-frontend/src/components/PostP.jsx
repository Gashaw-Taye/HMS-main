          Stubborn inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical and economic uncertainty, and labor shortages exacted a toll on private equity markets in 2023, and healthcare private equity was not immune. Healthcare buyout values fell but despite those challenges were in line with pre-Covid norms, as demographic trends and the wave of innovation unleashed during the pandemic fueled deal activity. Now there are signals that momentum is picking up, as evidenced by a rising deal volume relative to 2022. Buyers and sellers have a vested interest in bridging valuation gaps to make 2024 a year for catching up. 

This yearâ€™s report focuses on the forces creating major opportunities for investors and their portfolio companies, from generative AI to the burgeoning Indian market to innovation in life sciences.
